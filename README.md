> A recipe app using the Forkify API that allows users to search recipes of food they are craving as well as save them for later.

<b>Built with</b>: React, localStorage, Firebase (Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting)

## Inspiration
As I'm moving to Seattle this summer for my first internship, I decided to make this app so I can easily look up recipes for food I want to cook.

## What it does
Users can search for a keyword of a dish they'd like to cook, and the app, through the Forkify API, will return and display a list of recipes for users to choose. They can then select a recipe to view in more detail with info on prep time, ingredients, and directions. Users can also "like" a recipe, which will then be saved via localStorage (if not logged in) or Firebase Cloud Firestore (if logged in).
